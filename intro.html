  <h2 align=center>Hi!  Welcome to</h2>
  <h1 align=center>Will It Land?</h1>
  <h2 align=center>HOW IT WORKS</h2>
  <p align="center">Your goal is to land the rocket safely and vertically.  You can set the
  rocket's initial velocity, and some other parameters.  Then, you must decide
  in advance which altitude your motor should restart, how long it should run
  for, and how much thrust it should give.<br>
  
  If your rocket doesn't land safely, it will explode!  Your astronauts will
  have died and it's all your fault.<br>
  
  Good luck!</p>
